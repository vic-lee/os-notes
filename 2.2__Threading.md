## Notes

### What is a thread 

- Threads: a process within a process

- - Within a process, there can be multiple threads
  - Threads within one process shares the same address space
  - Threads share the processor with other threads 

- Know threads vs. processes difference

- Why threads / Threads usage:

- - Part of a program can be blocked, but other parts may still do some computation 
  - Processes don’t share the same address space, but threads do => more collaboration 
  - Threads are much more lighter than processes (because they share a lot of things)

- Multithreading: need to consider scheduling different threads, dependencies from one thread to another

- - Multiple threads do not actually run in parallel

- See slides for example

- Threads are like processes 

- - Have same states (running, ready, blocked)

  - Have their own stacks

  - -  Stacks contain frames for procedure calls (local variables, return addresses)

- `thread_yied`: relinquishes the processor; akin to preempting a process <= scheduler does that for processes 

### Two modes of threads

#### Threads in user space

- Pros:

- - No OS modification 
  - No context switching, so it would be faster
  - Scheduler can be customized for each application (garbage collector thread)

- Cons:

- - If a thread makes a sys call, it blocks all the other threads (because OS does not know there are multiple threads)

  - - Solutions: no elegant solution; might support non-blocking version of calls (e.g. non-blocking read)

  - Page fault blocks entire process 

  - Threads w/ infinite loops …. Waste resource

#### Threads in kernel space

- Pros: 

- - One thread table, entire OS

  - - If one thread is blocked, page fault, or infinite loop, 
    - switch to another thread (not necessarily from the same process)

- Cons:

- - OS support: significant modifications to the OS
  - Expensive to manage: thread calls become sys calls; but these calls are still faster than managing processes
