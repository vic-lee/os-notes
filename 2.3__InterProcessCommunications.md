# 2.3. Inter-process Communications

Module covered from 02/25/19 to 02/27/19.

## Notes

- things to consider
  - do not corrupt another process (a process's state, etc.)
  - ensure proper execution sequence

### 2.3.1 Race conditions

- processes may share the same common storage (main memory, shared file)
  - output is different depending on process execution sequence 
  - can be more than 2 processes competing 
- **critical section** is part of the program where a share memory is accessed 
- **mutual exclusion** prohibits reading and writing the shared resource at the same time 
  - therefore, if process A is in its critical section, and if process B attempts to run its critical section, process B will be blocked until process A leaves its critical section 

### 2.3.2 requirements for critical section implementation

1. no 2 processes can be simultaneously inside their critical sections 
2. no assumption on the number of CPUs, number of concurrent processes/threads
3. no process outside its critical region may block others from getting in critical regions 
4. no process should have to wait forever to enter its critical section (when is forever?)

### 2.3.3 Mutual exclusion with busy waiting

- Proposals for acheiving mutual exclusion
  - disabling interrupts
  - lock variables 
  - strict alternation
  - the TSL instruction 

#### Disabling inputs

- process disable interrupts just after entering the critical zone 
  - prevent others from intervening 
- not good
  - doesnt't work for user-mode programs (usermode programs don't use interrupts)
  - disabling interrupts for too long may make the OS seem unresponsive (can't fulfill 4th requirement)

#### Lock variable

- software solution
  - before entering a crucial section, set a variable that locks the other process out of the critical section 
- doesn't work
  - 1) check the lock; 2) set the lock; 
  - problem: another program may check between 1) and 2) and think the lock is open, and enter the critical section, although the variable was about to be locked. (violate 1st requirement)

#### Strict aternation

- **spin lock**: variable *turn* keeps track of whose turn it is to enter the critical region
  - **busy waiting**: process 1 continuously testing to see when *turn* becomes 1
- violates the 3rd requirement: a process that is done with the critical section should not prevent other processes from entering
  - what if a process is (much) faster than the other? during the turn, process a is done but process b is may still be in the `non_critical()` section
  - [enter code snippet]
- **Peterson's solution** [read book for example]
  - before entering the critical regions each process calls `enter_region` with its own process numbers
  - ...
  - ...

#### Test and Set Lock (aka Test and Set)

- essentially the same solution as above, but with hardware support
- hardware support solves the problem in the previous solution 
  - TSL instruction reads content of LOCK into register RX and sets it 1
  - the operation of reading and writing is inseparable (atomic)
    - atomic: in this case, the operation of testing and setting either both happens, or none of them happens, and no other process can interfere during the sub-instructions within the atomic instruction 
  - LOCK is used as a shared variable 

### 2.3.5 Semaphores 

- abstraction to control access to shared resource (incremented / decremented, toggled)
- **Atomic operations**: a group of related operations that are either completed without interruptions or not at all 

#### Binary semaphores (Mutexes)

- An abstraction for TSL lock
- a semaphore, S, has two states "open" and "closed"
- two operations, `P` and `V`
  - P(s) or DOWN(s) checks if S is open and sets it to close in an atomic operation 
  - V(s) or UP(s)  sets S to open 

Every program is doing this: 

```
loop forever
	DOWN(S)
	CS
	UP(s)
	NCS
```

- Because DOWN and UP are atomic operations, this prevents the problems in 2) lock variable 
- Once the lock is UP, some other process will be able to toggle DOWN

#### Counting semaphores

- Allows a number of proceses in the critical region `initially S=k`
- P(s) checks if the value is greater than 0 and if so decrements 
- V(s) increases thje value 

##### The Producer-Consumer Problem (bounded buffer problem)

- producer and consumer <u>share a common fixed size buffer</u> 
- producer puts information in the buffer 
- consumer takes information out of the buffer 
- when buffer is full, producer waits for non-full buffer (busy-waiting)
- when buffer is empty, consumer waits non-empty buffer (busy-waiting)
- combine counting semaphores and binary semaphores (binary creates semi-critical sections)
- [insert code snippet]

##### The dining philosopher's problem

- five philosophers: each has one plate; fork between two philosophers; need 2 forks to eat
- Loop: think —> get hungry —> eat

##### The readers and writers problem 

- two classes of processes
  - Readers, which can work concurrently (allow multiple reads)
  - writers, which need exclusive access 
    - (when a process writes, other processes cannot read nor write)
