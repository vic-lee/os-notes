## Notes

- things to consider
  - do not corrupt another process (a process's state, etc.)
  - ensure proper execution sequence

### Race conditions

- processes may share the same common storage (main memory, shared file)
  - output is different depending on process execution sequence 
  - can be more than 2 processes competing 
- **critical section** is part of the program where a share memory is accessed 
- **mutual exclusion** prohibits reading and writing the shared resource at the same time 
  - therefore, if process A is in its critical section, and if process B attempts to run its critical section, process B will be blocked until process A leaves its critical section 

#### requirements for critical section implementation

1. no 2 processes can be simultaneously inside their critical sections 
2. no assumption on the number of CPUs, number of concurrent processes/threads
3. no process outside its critical region may block others from getting in critical regions 
4. no process should have to wait forever to enter its critical section (when is forever?)

#### Mutual exclusion with busy waiting
