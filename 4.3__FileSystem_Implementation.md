### 4.3.6 Journaling File Systems

Keep a log of what is going to happen, so that when crashes happen we have a source to trace problems.

Key steps:

1. Write a log entry listing the action to be completed
2. Ensure the log entry is written to disk
3. Start executing sub-tasks
4. Check that all sub-tasks are completed, then mark the entry as complete (the entry will eventually be erased)

If the system crashes, the system checks if there are any pending operations; the system finishes the pending operations first, then returns to user.

For journaling to work, the logged operations must be **idempotent** (can be repeated as often as necessary without harm)
