## Notes

### Requriements for files

1. size: allow large size
2. persistence: don't lose data
3. concurrent access: allow multiple processes to access the information concurrently

File is an abstraction mechanism (the hardware knows nothing).

- a way to store files on disk and access later

### Naming files

- uniform file name space that allow for persistence and concurrent access (avoid crashes)
- file name -> unique file (abs. or relative path)
  - think of fname as a unique id that _points to_ a piece of information 
    - file names can change, but their underlying information do not.

### File name extensions

- extensions are helpful to indicate something about the file
  - sometimes required by the OS (.exe for executable in Windows)
  - sometimes expected by certain programs (e.g. compiler)
  - default behavior (html -> browser)
  - convey meaning to humans (my.trips)
- In Unix you may have multiple file extensions (e.g. `file.html.zip`)

### File structure

theee common modes:

1. Byte streams
   - used by Unix, macOS, Windows
   - all OS sees is bytes, user program can put anything in the file and name as they want
   - minimum structure
   - maximum flexibility
2. A sequence of fixed-length records
   - each record comes with some internal structure 
   - _Read_ operation returns 1 record; _Write_ operation operates and appends one record
     - 80-character records for card images
     - 133-character records for line printer files
3. Tree of records 
   - each record contains a key field in a fixed positiohn which is used to quickly find a record

### File types

- Regular files: contains user info.
- Directories: system files for maintaining the structure of the file system
- Device files: 
  - Character special files: related to I/O and used to model serial I/O devices
  - Block special files: used to model disks
- Links: give a file additional names (links are different from shortcuts in Windows)

### Regular files (ASCII text)

- ASCII
- 7-bit characters
- Each line ends with End of Line (EOL) character
- Advantage:
  - can bve directly printed and edited with the text editor

### Binary files

- a stream of bytes
- consist of internal structure known to programs using them
- even though the file is just a sequence of bytes some structure can be imposed 
  - Will only be executed if it has a specific format

### File access

Two kinds of file access
1. Sequential access:
2. Random access: read bytes in any order
   - each access specifies which bytes are desired 
   - in Unix read/write is sequential; first you seek a byte (by specifying where you want to go); then you write

Note: in modern OSs all files support random access, although the OS will apply optimizations if it decides that it is probably being read sequentially.

File has attributes (creation time; key length; etc.)

### File operations (syscalls)

Create, delete, open, close, read, write, append, seek, get attributes, set attributes, rename

- **Create** (essential)
  - file is created with no data, sets some attributes (this operation can be merged with Open to avoid a separate system call)
- **Delete** (essential)
  - delete files to clear disk space
- **Open** (not essential)
  - translates a file name to the corresponding disk location
- **Close** (not essential)
  - frees table space used by attributes and addresses without waiting for process to terminate
- **Read** (essential)
  - need to specify:
    - location in the file
    - number of bytes to read
    - buffer into which data is placed (interesting)
- **Write** (essential)
  - data is written to file again usually to current position
    - current position == EOF -> file size increases
    - current position in the middle of the file -> existing data overwritten, lost forever
- **Append** (not seential)
  - restricted form of write, adds data at the end of the file
- **Seek** (not essential)
  - could be part of read/write
- **Get attributes** (essential)
  - Used by processes to make file attributes work (e.g. `make` requires files' latest modification time)
- **Set attributes** (maybe essential)
  - Essential if attributes are settable and can be changed after creation (e.g. modify protection attributes)
- **Rename**
  - copy-and-delete may not be possible for big files
  - copy-delete is not atomic

HardLinks:

- filenames point to another i-node (not a new i-node associated with a new file).
- Hard links can be created only for regular files, not directories.
- If the underlying file is removed, the hardlink still points to the same file (and is still accessbile, but not accessible in its original directory)
- If a file with the same name is created in the original file, the hardlink does not point to the new file; it still points to the old file (and can still modify it). Essentially, we have two files with the same name running in parallel.

SymLinks:

- Create a new file for symlink (not a regular file), which entails a new i-node
- if the underlying file is removed, the symlink becomes invalid
- if the underlying file is replaced (first removed then added a new file with the same name) with a new file, the symlink refers to the new file
- Removing the symlink has no effect on the underlying file
- SymLink allows linking to a directory (while hardlink does not allow this)
  - If `A/SymLink` points to directory `B/`, and file `B/y` exists, then `A/SymLink/y` is equivalent to accessing `B/y`.
