# 5.1 I/O Devices

## Table of contents

## Notes

Each IO device has a limit on data rate (e.g. 56K modem: 7kb/sec).

I/O usually requires a mechanical and an electronic component.

- _Mechanical component_: the **device** itself
- _Electronic component_: the **device controller** (from the OS's perspective this is the device)
  - Controllers can handle a couple identical devices

How the driver talks with the device controller?
