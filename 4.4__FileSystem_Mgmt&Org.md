# 4.4 File System Management and Organization

## Notes

### 4.1 Disk Space Management

- Files are chopped into fixed-sized blocks, which are scattered over the disk
- Choice of block size
- Trade off between performance and efficient memory utilization
  - Allocation unit too large: waste space
  - Allocation unit too small: waste performance

- Two approaches
  - bitmap: kernel memory region, store free/allocated blocks
    - 1 bit for each block (1: free; 0: allocated)\
  - Linked list of free blocks
    - waste no space; poor performance (require I/O for acquisition of free blocks)

#### Backups

- Physical backup
  - Copies every block in order to secondary storage
    - Not useful for retrieving individual file(s) (more for disaster protection)
- Logical backups
  - recursive dumps
  - Full (level 0) dump
    - Backup everything
  - An incremental dump (level n)
    - Dump files that have changed since the most recent dump (k < n ?)
    - e.g.
      - Level 0 dump every 3 years
      - Level 4 dump every Sunday
      - Level 5 dump every other weekday

### File System Consistency

- System crash -> file system in an inconsistent state
- Modern OS have utilities for this
  - Unix: `fsck`; Windows `chkdsk`

### File System Performance

#### Read Block Ahead

- If the OS determines that this is (probably) a sequential read, the OS prefetches the `k+1` block once the process requests block `k`
  - Keep track of the access patterns: if `seek` is used then it is random access, not sequential.

### Example File Systems

- CP/M File System
  - little RAM and disk space
  - one directory in the entire system
- MS-DOS File System
  - multiple directories & subdirectories
    - (FAT-12, FAT-16 (number indicates block size), supported in every operating system today, great for compatibility)
- Windows 98 File System
  - Long file names
  - FAT-32 (only use 28 words, not 32 bit for each block)
- The Unix V7 File System
  - i-node based system
  - Each directory contains a name and a pointer to the i-node
  - Metadata stored on the node
  - Support long file names
  - Get down a level requries 2 steps: 1. get i-node, 2. get file (or subdirectory)
- CD-ROM
  - files cannot be added and deleted ->
    - no need to manage free blocks
    - files stored continuously
