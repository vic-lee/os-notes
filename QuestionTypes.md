# Question Types

## Process Scheduling algorithms

Given a list of processes, what will the _schedule_ be like? What's the _turnaround time_ for each process?

Attributes for a process

- Arrival time  [essential]
- CPU time (or runtime if there's no IO block)  [essential]
- IO-CPU switch [possible]
- IO block duration and time [possible]
- Priority      [possible]

Potential algorithms:

- FCFS
- SJF
- SRTN
- SPN
- RoundRobin
- Priority Scheduling
- Highest Penalty Ratio Next

**_The lab 2 rule (on how to break ties):_**

- If two processes have the same priority:
  - Favor the one with the earlier arrival time
  - Favor the one listed earlier in the input (if they have the same arrival time)

```
Turnaround time = Finish Time - Arrival Time     // note that arrival time is NOT start time

Wait time: time in ready state     // Don't forget the wait time b/t arrival & first run
```

_Example (sample midterm):_

| Process | CPU Time | Arrival Time | Blocks after | Blocks for |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| P0      | 10       | 0            | 5            | 9          |
| P1      | 11       | 4            | 4            | 6          |
| P2      | 9        | 4            | n/a          | n/a        |

If FCFS (this is non-preemptive):

```
TIME  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
P0    X X X X X b b b b  b  b  b  b  b              X  X  X  X  X  DONE
P1              X X X X  b  b  b  b  b  b                          X  X  X  X  X  X  X  DONE
P2                       X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  DONE
```

|     | Finish time | Wait time | Turnaround time |
| --- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| P0  | 23          | 10        | 23              |
| P1  | 30          | 15        | 26              |
| P2  | 18          | 0         | 26              |

If RR (dependent var: quantum = 3):

Sample _**mistake**_:
```
TIME  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
P0    x x x x x b b b b b  b  b  b  b     x  x  x                    x  x
P1              x x x         x  b  b  b  b  b  b  x  x  x                 x  x  x  x
P2                    x x x      x  x  x                    x  x  x
```

Correct:
```
TIME  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
P0    x x x x x b b b b  b  b  b  b  b     x  x  x           x  x
P1              x x x          x  b  b  b  b  b  b                 x  x  x  x  x  x  x
P2                    x  x  x     x  x  x           x  x  x
```

|     | Finish time | Wait time | Turnaround time |
| --- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| P0  | 23          | 4         | 23              |
| P1  | 30          | 10        | 26              |
| P2  | 21          | 9         | 17              |

Two mistakes:

1. Time is not 0-indexed; we start from 1
2. When a process becomes ready (from blocked), it is added to the **_end_** of the queue. That's why, at `t=19`, P0 switches to P2, not to P1 (P1 just finished IO and is added to the end of the list)

If Highest Penalty Ratio Next:

```
Penalty ratio = T / t
    T: time in system: current time - arrival time
    t: time running (initially 1 to avoid DIV/0!)
```

HPR is non-preemptive: scheduling only happens after a burst (IO or CPU) ends.

```
TIME  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
P0    X X X X X b b b b  b  b  b  b  b                 X  X  X  X  X  DONE
P1              X X X X  b  b  b  b  b  b                             X  X  X  X  X  X  X  DONE
P2                       X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  DONE
```

| Arrival Time |                  | T = 6       | T = 9        | T = 20     |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 0            | P0 penalty ratio | 6 / 5 = 1.2 | 9 / 5 = 1.8  | 20 / 5 = 4 |
| 4            | P1 penalty ratio | 2 / 1 = 2   | 5 / 4 = 1.25 | 16 / 4 = 4 |
| 4            | P2 penalty ratio | 2 / 1 = 2   | 5 / 1 = 5    |            |

|     | Finish time | Wait time | Turnaround time |
| --- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| P0  | 24          | 5         | 24              |
| P1  | 31          | 10        | 27              |
| P2  | 19          | 5         | 15              |

Notes:

- Because the algorithm is non-preemptive, once P2 starts running at T=10 (because P0 & 1 are both blocked) it runs until it finishes

### Difference between Shortest Process Next, Shortest Job First (SJF), and Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)

- **Shortest process next [non-preemptive]**: schedules based on the estimated time of a process; shortest process given highest priority
  - `new estimate = A * old estimate + (1 - A) * last burst   // initial est. given; 1 < A < 1`
- **Shortest job first [non-preemptive]**: when processes arrive, they come with their CPU time. Processes with the shortest runtime given priority.
- **Shortest remaining time next [preemptive]**: When a new process arrives, its runtime (provided) is compared w/ the remaining runtime [runtime - time ran] of the current process. If new process has a shorter remaining time, the current process is preempted.

## Disk Scheduling Algorithms

1. FCFS
2. Pick
3. SSTF or SSF
4. Elevator (look, scan)
5. N-step scan
6. Circular elevator (circular scan, circular look)

### What is the primary disadvantage of FCFS for DSA, and which algorithm improves this shortcoming

Seek time cannot be optimised. Pick optimizes seek time somewhat by removing repetitive arm movements.

### What is the primary drawback of SSTF (or SSF)

Fairness is sacrificed. With SSTF the arm would tend to stay in the middle.

_Sample question (HW25)_

A local area network is used as follows. The user issues a system call to write data packets to the network. The operating system then **copies** the data to a kernel buffer. Then it **copies** the data to the network controller board. When all the bytes are safely inside the controller, they are sent over the network at a rate of _**10 megabits/sec**_. The receiving network controller _**stores each bit a microsecond**_ after it is sent. When the last bit arrives, the destination CPU is _**interrupted**_, and the kernel **copies** the newly arrived packet to a kernel buffer to inspect it. Once it has figured out which user the packet is for, the kernel **copies** the data to the user space. If we assume that each _**interrupt**_ and its associated processing takes 1 msec, that **packets are 1024 bytes** (ignore the headers), and that copying a byte takes 1 Î¼sec, **what is the maximum rate at which one process can pump data to another**? Assume that the sender is blocked until the work is finished at the receiving side and an acknowledgment comes back. For simplicity, assume that the time to get the acknowledgment back is so small it can be ignored.

```
1 microsecond = 1/1,000 milisecond = 1/1,000,000 second

package size = 1024 bytes = 2^10 bytes = 2^20 bits
OTA data transfer rate = 10MB / sec = 10 * 2^20 bytes / sec = 10 * 2^30 bits / sec
copy rate = 1 byte / microsecond = 1,000,000 bytes / second
controller rate = 1 bit / microsecond = 1/2^10 byte / microsecond = 1,000,000 / 2^10 byte / second

1. OS copies to kernel buffer
2. copies to network controller board
3. OTA
4. store on receiving network controller
5. interrupt
6. kernel copies to buffer
7. kernel copies to user space

copy time = 2^10 / 1,000,000 secs

controller storing on receiving server takes 2^20 microseconds = 2^20 / 1,000,000 seconds

total time required = 4 * 2^10 / 1,000,000      // copy time
                    + 0.002                     // interrupt
                    + 1 / (10 * 2^10)           // OTA
                    + 2^20 / 1,000,000          // controller
                    = 0.004096 + 0.002 + 0.000098 + 1.048576
                    = 1.05477

```

## Page Replacement Algorithms (PRAs)

1kb = 2^10 bytes
1 byte = 2^3 bits

```
NumPage = AddresseSpace / PageSize      // also NumPTE
PageTableSize = NumPTE * PTESize
```

Question format:

input: PRA, NumPageFrame, NumPage, ReferenceString
output: NumPageFaults

Solution:

Implement a page frame table where # columns = NumPageFrame.
At each page fault, record a new row indicating the page replaced, based on PRA. The page being replaced is the one directly above the incoming page.

_example: Q28 Ch3:_

If FIFO page replacement is used with four page frames and eight pages, how many page faults will occur with the reference string 0172 3271 03 if the four frames are initially empty? Now repeat this problem for LRU.

_Do not confuse FIFO with LRU._

_For FIFO:_

**0**
0 **1**
0 1 **7**
0 1 7 **2**
**3** 1 7 2
3 1 7 **0**

6 faults.

_For LRU:_

**0**
0 **1**
0 1 **7**
0 1 7 **2**
**3** 1 7 2
**0** 1 7 2
0 1 7 **3**

7 faults.

### Difference between LRU and NRU

- **LRU (least recently used)** simply keeps track of the times at which a page has been referenced lately (_alternatively, the scheduler can keep track of a linked list of all pages that moves a page to the end when referenced._) The one with the oldest latest reference time is the viction.
- **NRU (not recently used)** is quite different from LRU, despite the similarity in their naming. Using R and M bits, the algorithm separates pages into 4 categories. The lowest numbered page from the first non-empty class is the viction. Below are the classes, in order of preference:
  - Class 0:  R = 0, M = 0
  - Class 1:  R = 0, M = 1
  - Class 2:  R = 1, M = 0    // prefers recently R-ed to M-ed
  - Class 3:  R = 1, M = 1    // last resort

### Why is LRU not used in practice, and what algorithms have been proposed as an approximation for LRU

The LRU is not used in practice because it is expensive: memory references happen very frequently, recording a timestamp _every time_ a reference occurs incurs a significant performance overhead.

To approximate LRU, two algorithms have been proposed to keep track of reference recency. One is **NFU**, which counts a page's cumulative R (it adds the R bit and resets it every cycle). An issue with this algorithm is that it does not distinguish between old and new references, thereby discriminates against younger residents. Another is **Aging**, which addresses NFU's issue by evicting page frames with older references. 

### Difference between NFU and NRU

- **NFU (not frequently used)** attempts to evict based reference frequency. The algorithm approximates reference frequency by keeping track of the a page's sum of Rs. The page with the lowest total reference count is evicted.
  - Aside: what is the issue with this algorithm?
- **NRU (not recently used)** attempts to evict track of recency. It determines a page's reference recency based on its R and M bits (see above). Pages referenced recently but not modified is considered a more ideal resident than pages modified but not referenced recently.

_**Note that total reference count does not equate to the sum of Rs**_. R == 1 merely indicates that a page has been referenced in a clock cycle; it could be referenced once or multiple times, and R does not record this information. 

### What is the biggest issue with NFU and what algorithm attempts to address it

The issue with NFU, which keeps track of each page's total R, is that it favors old residents and discriminates against new residents. Conceivably, page frames which have not been swapped out for a long time likely has a high total reference count, giving it a low priority level for eviction. New pages come and go (chosen for eviction), because every time a page fault occurs, it is difficult for the relatively new page to compete with the old page, given its long-standing record of memory references. This makes older pages' total references count even higher. The situation hence becomes a vicious cycle.

**The aging PRA** copes with this issue. Instead of adding the R bit at every clock cycle, aging right shifts the counter and prepends the R bit, thereby giving most recent references a much higher weighting. While one of aging's compromises is that it can only look back `n` cycles (the length of the counter) while NFU looks back `2^n`, in practice, if a page has not been referenced in `n` cycles it probably is not that important.

### Why would one prefer WSClock over the Working Set algorithm

Working Set refers to `W(k, t)` for any given process, where k is the number of most recent references and t is the current time. While the idea is great in theory, keeping track of the working set by updating it upon every memory reference is prohibitly expensive. One could imagine a system where the OS performs a right shift of a bit string of pages referenced when there's a new page referenced.

WSClock is much less expensive because it does not require such right shifting. The algporithm approximates working sets by using time instead of K number of references: if a page is referenced more than ð time ago, it is outside of the working set.

### Why is second-chance preferable to FIFO

Second-chance provides a substantial improvement to FIFO because it tries to avoid evicting old page frames that are nonetheless referenced _recently_. Frames referenced recently are likely to be referenced again soon (the locality of reference), the thinking goes.

Specifically, second-chance checks whether the head of a FIFO queue of page frames satisfies R == 1. If so, the R bit is reset and the page placed at the end of the queue ("second chance": as if the page has just arrived). The page evicts the first R == 0 page frame it finds.

## Deadlock Recovery

### Name the necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur

1. **_Mutual exclusion_**: only one process can have access to a resource
2. **_Hold & wait_**: a resource is allowed to request more resources when it already holds one
3. **_Non-preemptive_**: the OS cannot preemptively take back a resource from a process
4. **_Circular Wait_**: there exists a circular waiting list

### How can we prevent / recover from a deadlock now that we know the 4 pre-conditions for deadlock

1. For mutual exclusion: we allow multiple processes to access a resource at the same time. This is readily achievable for read-only resources (e.g. reading a file); for writing access, a spooling system such as that for the printer can be introduced.
2. For hold & wait: processes must request _all_ the resource they need when they start. This is often not realistic because processes may not know what they need.
3. For non-preemptive: we give OS the ability to take back a resource. This is often not realistic because it may not make sense for the OS to stop a process from using a resource at a random time.
4. For circular wait: we order resources with a numerical code. Requests must be made in consistency with this order (e.g. if printer is 3 and disk is 11, then a process must always request printer first, then disk).

## Deadlock Prevention -- Safety State & the Banker's Algorithm

A state is _**safe**_ if and only if there exists a sequence in which every process can request up to its maximum claim and terminate.

Banker's Algorithm implementation:

- Implement three matrices: **CurrentResourceOwnership**, **MaxUnmetDemands**, and **ResourceAvailability**. For CurrentResourceOwnership and MaxUnmetDemands, the columns are resources and rows are processes.
- While CurrentResourceOwnership != 0:
  - Find a row in MaxUnmetDemands that is < than ResourceAvailability
    - pretend that row is finished by releasing its CurrentResourceOwnership to ResourceAvailability
  - Else, there's no remaining process that can be satisfied by ResourceAvailability; break
- Repeat this process for all possible entry points; remember, we only need _one_ successful sequence for the state to be safe

Sample question (HW13):

```
    ResourceOwnership   Claim           MaxUnmetDemand  
P1  1 0 2 1 1           1 1 2 1 1       0 1 0 0 0
P2  2 0 1 1 1           2 2 2 1 1       0 2 1 0 0
P3  1 1 0 1 0           2 1 3 1 0       1 0 3 0 0
P4  1 1 1 1 0           1 1 2 2 1       0 0 1 1 1

ResourceAvailability
0 0 X 1 1
```

Solve for the smallest X for which there exists a safe state.

1. Find the MaxUnmetDemand matrix, as written above.
2. The only process whose MaxUnmetDemand can be satisfied is P4. X is at least 1.

```
ResourceAvailability:
  0 0 1 1 1
+ 1 1 1 1 0
= 1 1 2 2 1
```

3. Next satisfy P1, it is the only process that can be satisfied.

```
ResourceAvailability:
  1 1 2 2 1
+ 1 0 2 1 1
= 2 1 4 3 2
```

4. Next satisfy P3.

```
ResourceAvailability:
  2 1 4 3 2
+ 1 1 0 1 0
= 3 2 4 4 2
```

5. Finally, satisfy P2.

```
ResourceAvailability:
  3 2 4 4 2
+ 2 0 1 1 1
= 5 2 5 5 3
```

## Virtual to Physical Address Translation

Two types of questions:

1. VA --> [    Page Frame #    ][  Offset  ]
2. VA --> [ Seg # ][ Page Frame #][ Offset ]

_**Example (sample final)**_

Assume a system has demand paging with a page size of 4000 bytes, but does NOT have segmentation. Assume all page table entries (PTEs) are 1 word (4 bytes) long. Also assume the system does NOT have a TLB (translation lookaside buffer).

How large (in bytes) is the page table for a 64,000,000 byte process?

```
NumPages = AddrSpace / PageSize = 16,000
PageTableSize = NumPages * PTESize = 16,000 * 4 = 64,000 bytes
```

Describe the actions that occur for a reference to byte 54321. Be sure to indicate any memory references that must occur and any I/O operations that might occur.

```
Offset = VirAddr % PageSize = 54321 % 4000 = 2321
PageNumber = 54321 / 4000 = 13

Go to the PageTable (memref), find the 13th entry.

If the page is resident:
  get page frame number.

Else:
  Block the process until I/O is complete.

  If there is free frame:
    Bring in the actual page from disk and write to a free frame.

  Else:
    Use PRA to find a victim to evict.
    Once identified, see if the victim is dirty.

    If dirty:
      schedule the frame to be written to disk.

    Bring in the actual page from disk; overwrite the victim.

  Go to the PageTable to update the PTE (frame number, is resident).
  At this point we can calculate the PhyAddr.

PhyAddr = (PageFrameNumber - 1) * FrameSize + Offset
Memref: access the physical address
```

D (5 points). Consider a computer with four page frames and a process with 8 pages. Assume the pages are referenced in the following order 6127372163. Which of these references will cause page faults if the LRU page replacement algorithm is used. Assume the 4 frames are initially invalid, i.e. contain no pages.

## List of Concepts and Explainers

### Semaphores

- **DOWN(S)** or **P(S)**:
  - If the semaphore is greater than 0, it is decremented
  - If the semaphore is 0, the process is put to `sleep` _without finishing the DOWN call_.
- **UP(S)** or **V(S)**:
  - increments the semaphore's value
  - if there are processes _sleeping on_ the semaphore (i.e. incomplete DOWN calls), one of them is chosen at random to finish DOWN. Thus, upon finishing the semaphore will still be 0, but there's one less process sleeping.

Operations on semaphores are **atomic**. Usually, `P(S)` and `V(S)` are implemented as system calls. When each call is initiated, the kernel temporarily disables interrupts, ensuring the atomicity of the operations.

Aside:

- _**sleep**_ is a system call that blocks the calling process, until another process wakes it up. 
- _**wakeup**_ is another system call with one parameter: the process to be woken up.

### Mutexes

Mutex is a special type of semaphore (a binary semaphore) for achieving **mutual exclusion**. A mutex has two states: unlocked (0) and locked (any non-0 number).

P(S) or DOWN(S) _**locks**_ the mutex if it is not already locked.
V(S) or UP(S) _**unlocks**_ the mutex.

Therefore, code achieving mutual exclusion resembles something like: 

```c
while (1)
{
  P(S);         // DOWN(S)
  CS();
  V(S);         // UP(S)
  NCS();
}
```

### What is `thread_yield` and in what situation may `thread_yield` be used

In the event that a process attempts but fails to enter into a critical region (i.e. calling P(S) when the semaphore is 0), the calling process is put to sleep, until awakened later by V(S).

`Thread_yield` is the thread equivalent for `sleep` for processes. When a thread runs P(S) and fails to enter, it calls `thread_yield` to give up its CPU time, allowing other threads to run. If `thread_yield` is not called, the process would be stuck on constantly checking the lock (busy-waiting).

### The producer-consumer problem (the bounded-buffer problem)

Consider a situation where two (or more) processes share the same buffer. When the producer detects the buffer is full, it goes to sleep until the consumer has removed one or more items, and notifies the producer. Similarly, when the consumer detects the buffer is empty, it goes to sleep until the producer has put in one or new items, and notifies the consumer.

A race condition may occur. Consider if the consumer just read in (but has not tested) that the buffer is empty; then, at a clock interrupt the scheduler switches to the producer. The producer, seeing that the buffer is empty, produces one item and "wakes" the consumer (because the buffer is originally empty and the consumer presumably sleeping). Note that the consumer is not actually asleep, however, and the wake call does not affect the consumer. When the scheduler runs the consumer, it sees that the value it read in was 0 (which is no longer true), and goes to sleep. Eventually, the producer will fill up the buffer and go to sleep too. The 2 processes will sleep forever.

The same race condition can be conceived for the consumer trying to wake a non-sleeping producer. Fundamental to solving this issue is the atomicity of the test-and-set operations (test if the size is 0 or full; increment / decrement number of items).

While hardware TSL locks can solve this issue, it requires busy-wait, which consumes significant CPU resources and is not entirely fault-proof (see the priority inversion problem). Semaphores have been proposed to solve the bounded-buffer problem.

### The dining philosophers problem

Consider a situation wherein there are 5 (or n) philosophers who are either thinking or eating. Philosophers sit at a round table, and between each philosopher there is a fork (5 forks in total). Each philosopher needs 2 forks to eat.

A deadlock may arise when every philosopher attempts to get their forks at the same time. If the procedure for acquiring forks are defined as 1) get left fork, 2) get right fork, each philsopher would acquire the left fork successfully, but they would be waiting for the right fork, which has been acquired by the philosopher to the right. This is a circular wait situation where every philosopher is waiting on another.

A simple "hack" would be to randomize the time intervals between which each philosopher eats, thereby greatly minimizing the possibility that all philosophers eat at once. However, this is not fault-proof as deadlocks may still occur.

Semaphores can solve the dining philosophers problem. A `mutex` is used for ensuring mutual exclusion for critical regions (getting and releasing forks), and a set of semaphores, one for each philosopher, is used to indicate whether a philosopher is "hungry" (attempted to get a fork but failed).

The implementation is as follows:

```c
#define N 5
#define EATING 1
......

typedef int semaphore;
semaphore mutex;
semaphore s[N];
int state[N];

To solve this issue, we place a semaphore on the database.
